[-]: very low priority
[ ]: to be done
[\]: started
[=]: cancelled or not possible

To do:

[ ] Configure LEDs behavior to indicate boot and shutdown period.

[ ] Write PIM information in Zynq I2C register (slave 0x67) 

[ ] Setting the MAC address to a value from the IPMC EEPROM without
custom compiling the code for each address

[ ] Making the active IPMC MAC and IP addresses available (perhaps by
writing to zynq I2C)

[ ] Change approach for I2C Mux: use variable to road "current user
channel" for user operations, instead of reading last state.

[ ] Rearrange command names per area (i2c_bus_set instead of
set_i2c_bus). Important to keep previous names as aliases.

[ ] Change how raw I2C handling is done (convert parameters directly
instead of using a 2-D vector).

[-] weird behavior of the command line interface, which is hanging up
sometimes...

    - hard to track because it does not always happen.

[-] make expert_mode associated to a specific connection (not global)

[-] delay between 12v and zynq enables

    - Not specified

---- done v

[X] Retrieve serial number and MAC address from flash and provide it to Zynq

[X] Separate signals from general help

[X] Command to read/write eeprom

[X] Command to change uart configuration

[X] Why sensors are not reported as NR when they are not available?

[X] temperature sensors not available in shelf manager when I2C mux is
blocked.

[X] initial state for signals

[X] fix line ended command line parser

[X] loop to wait for zynq to boot

    - poll Zynq I2C lines

    - when Zynq up, light up LEDs

[X] ensure IPMC uart signals are GND or high impedance on boot

[X] No rush, but please change

    - <SerialIntf>SDI_INTF</SerialIntf> to <SerialIntf>SDI_SOL</SerialIntf>

    - remove  <RedirectSDItoSOL/>

    * This is only useful for whom is not working on the IPMC directly

[X] create a config template for the devkit -> SM 0

[X] change signal name: SENSE_RST --> SENSE_RST_B

[X] investigate if debug messages can be sent via TCP/IP from IPMC to
computer directly, i.e. independent of the received requests. 

    - Yes, it is possible using ipmitool and SOL with SDI redirection

[X] Remove handle watch in the shutdown/power-up processes

---- cancelled v

[=] expose other signals of interest in the GPIO API

    - Signals not available for now.

[=] ensure IPMC XVC signals are GND or high impedance on boot
