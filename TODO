Legend:

[X]: done
[-]: very low priority
[ ]: to be done
[\]: started
[=]: cancelled or not possible

To do:

[ ] weird behavior of the command line interface, which is hanging...

    - hard to track because it does not always happen.

[X] temperature sensors not available in shelf manager when I2C mux is blocked. 

[X] initial state for signals

[ ] delay between 12v and zynq enables

    - Not specified

[X] fix line ended command line parser

[\] loop to wait for zynq to boot

    - poll Zynq I2C lines

    - when Zynq up, light up LEDs

[X] ensure IPMC uart signals are GND or high impedance on boot

[=] ensure IPMC XVC signals are GND or high impedance on boot

[X] No rush, but please change

    - <SerialIntf>SDI_INTF</SerialIntf> to <SerialIntf>SDI_SOL</SerialIntf>

    - remove  <RedirectSDItoSOL/>

    * This is only useful for whom is not working on the IPMC directly

[X] create a config template for the devkit -> SM 0

[-] make expert_mode associated to a specific connection (not global)

[X] change signal name: SENSE_RST --> SENSE_RST_B

[X] investigate if debug messages can be sent via TCP/IP from IPMC to
computer directly, i.e. independent of the received requests. 

    - Yes, it is possible using ipmitool and SOL with SDI redirection

[=] expose other signals of interest in the GPIO API

    - Signals not available for now.

[ ] Configure LEDs behavior to indicate boot and shutdown period.

[ ] Remove handle watch in the shutdown/power-up processes

[ ] Retrieve serial number and MAC address from flash and provide it to Zynq

[ ] Write PIM information in Zynq I2C register (slave 0x67)
